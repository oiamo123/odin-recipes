So far so good. I personally think i've been doing quite well in regards to HTML however that isn't really the purpose of learning for me but rather to learn something new and have a kick-ass time doing it ahah. 
As for what i've learned so far:
'p' for paragraphs
'a' for attributes
'a href' to link webpages
'img src' for images
'h1-h6'
'strong'
'em' 
How to setup up a html website from scratch as well as
create multiple images
How to use linux terminal to create directories and files

Add index.html to end of link in order to access my sick af recipe website
