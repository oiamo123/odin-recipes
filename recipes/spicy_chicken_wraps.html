        <h1>Buffalo Chicken Wraps</h1>

        <p>My favorite Buffalo Chicken Wrap includes juicy buffalo chicken layered on crunchy fresh veggies, topped with cheese and creamy dressing and wrapped tightly in a delicious flour tortilla. </p>
        <p>Wraps are so easy to make from home, and they're more fun to eat then sandwiches, so my family adores them! Some of my other favorite wrap recipes include Chicken Cashew Wraps and Crispy Southwest Wraps.</p>
        <p>Anything with “buffalo” in the name immediately perks my ears up! I love the tangy, spicy flavors in Buffalo wings, buffalo chicken dip, and these Buffalo Chicken Wraps are so fresh and delicious. The spice level is mild because of the other ingredients, so add some hot sauce if you want them spicier.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breats</li>
            <li>2 tables olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Frank's Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Blue cheese or Ranch dressing</li>
            <li>2 cups Romaine lettuces, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup carrot, shredded</li>
            <li>1/2 cup avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice chicken breast into several long, thin strips.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, hot sauce, paprika, garlic powder and salt. Add chicken and allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes (or up to 24 hours).</li>
            <li>In a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the chicken strips. Cook until no longer pink, about 4-5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place tortillas on a plate and spread with a thin layer of bleu cheese or ranch dressing. Layer with lettuce, carrots, avocado, and cheese.</li>
            <li>Arrange a few chicken strips down the center of each tortilla. Wrap tightly, like a burrito. Serve with a side of hot sauce or extra dressing, if desired! Enjoy!</li>
