        <h1>Waffles I </h1>
        <img src="../images/waffles.jpg" alt="waffles">
        <p>Culinary historians believe waffles can be traced back to ancient Greece, where chefs roasted flat cakes between metal plates attached to long wooden handles. The Greeks called these cakes obelios, and they weren't as sweet as modern waffles.</p>
        <p>Despite the potential for weight gain, I personally like to set that thought aside just before digging into these.</p>
        <p>You can keep the batter covered in the fridge for up to a week. Just be sure to whisk well before using again. You may also use whole wheat flour for this recipe.</p>
